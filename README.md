This repository is forked from the excellent [jfrazelle/.vim](https://github.com/jfrazelle/.vim) repository. All credit and many thanks for its content goes to her.

My vim dot files. the `.vimrc` file is saved to [vimrc](https://github.com/petersellars/.vim/blob/master/vimrc).

Just run the following commands via terminal to get perfectly set up:

```console
$ cd ~/
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:petersellars/.vim.git .vim
$ ln -sf $HOME/.vim/vimrc $HOME/.vimrc
```
